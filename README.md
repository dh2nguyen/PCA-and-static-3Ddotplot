# PCA-and-static-3Ddotplot

I uploaded this script as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), so if you are used to the .py version, you will have to download the .ipynb file and convert it to .py.

 This script does PCA, exports the values for the first 3 PCs for each sample, and also prints a static 3D dotplot
